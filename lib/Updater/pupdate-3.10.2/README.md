A free utility for updating the openFPGA cores, firmware, and a bunch of other stuff on your Analogue Pocket.

A complete list of available cores can also be found here: [https://openfpga-cores-inventory.github.io/analogue-pocket/](https://openfpga-cores-inventory.github.io/analogue-pocket/)

I can't (and don't want to) support old versions, so please make sure you download the latest release before submitting any issues.

## Easy Mode ##

If you just want to use this utility, do not clone the source repository. Just download the [latest release](https://github.com/mattpannella/pupdate/releases/latest/). Unzip it, put the executable file for your platform (windows, mac os, or linux) in the root of your sd card, and run the program.

At the main menu run `Settings` to have it walk through the available settings for you.

## Interactive Console Menu ##

For a full view of the interactive console menu, see [here](MENU.md).

### Update All
Install/Update all of your cores, plus a bunch of other stuff. It can basically be used as the "do everything I want" option. Everything marked with a * can be turned on/off via settings.
1. Checks for new firmware updates *
2. Compress and backup Saves and Memories *
3. Installs/updates every core you have selected
4. Checks for missing required assets for each core you have selected *
5. Deletes cores that you do not have selected *
6. Runs the instance JSON generator for each core you have selected (currently, only PC Engine CD) *
7. Rename every Jotego core you have selected *

### Update Firmware
Self explanatory. Just checks for firmware updates and exits.

### Select Cores

This will prompt you to ask if you want new cores installed by default, with 3 options:
- Yes
    - Selecting this automatically chooses all existing cores, and will continue to automatically install new cores as they are released.
- No
    - Selecting this means as new cores are released, they will not be installed automatically, nor will you be asked about them. Then you will be presented with a list of all currently available cores, to select from for yourself.
- Ask
    - Selecting this means as new cores are released, you will be notified each time you run the app and have the option to select them for installation.  Then you will be presented with a list of all currently available cores, to select from for yourself.

### Download Assets

Checks for missing assets for each core you have selected (mainly arcade ROM files and BIOSes).

_Note: You are responsible for finding and adding your own ROMs for non-arcade cores._

### Backup Saves & Memories

This will compress the Saves and Memories directories from your Pocket to the location specified in the config settings.


### Pocket Setup - Download Platform Image Packs

This will present you with a list of available image packs and automatically download and extract it to the Platforms/_images directory for you

### Pocket Setup - Download Pocket Library Images

This will download the System Library Images that were published by Spiritualized1997. They are used for the Library functionality on the Pocket.

### Pocket Setup - Download GameBoy Palettes

This will download the palette files for the Pocket GameBoy cartridges. This is currently maintained by [davewongillies](https://github.com/davewongillies/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/davewongillies/openfpga-palettes) and by R.A.Helllord on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/834264850230018058/1199625145405407273) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnaloguePocket/comments/18q2iz1/collection_of_all_official_game_boy_color_and/).

### Pocket Setup - Generating Instance JSON Files (PC Engine CD)

- Only supported by PC Engine CD, currently

- Put your games in /Assets/{platform}/common

- Each game needs to be in its own directory (and be sure to name the directory the full title of the game)

- Examples:
    - /Assets/pcecd/common/Rondo of Blood
    - /Assets/pcecd/common/Bonk
    - etc

- All games (for PC Engine CD) must be in cue/bin format. The generated json file will be saved using the same filename as the cue file, so be sure to also name that with the full title of the game

- When you run the `Generate Instance JSON Files` or `Update All` menu items, it will search through every directory in common and create a json file that can be launched by the core

- You can disable this process in Update All by setting `build_instance_jsons` to `false` in your settings file, if you don't want it to run every time you update.

### Pocket Setup - Generate Game & Watch ROMs

How to build game and watch roms that are compatible with the Pocket:

Create 2 new folders.

`/Assets/gameandwatch/agg23.GameAndWatch/artwork` and `/Assets/gameandwatch/agg23.GameAndWatch/roms`

Place your `[artwork].zip` files into the artwork folder and your `[rom]`.zip files into the roms folder

Should look like this:

```
/Assets/gameandwatch/agg23.GameAndWatch/artwork/gnw_dkong.zip

/Assets/gameandwatch/agg23.GameAndWatch/roms/gnw_dkong.zip
```

Now just run the menu option in the updater and it will build your games

### Pocket Setup - Enable All Display Modes

This will enable all of the Pocket Display Modes for the openFPGA cores.

### Pocket Setup - Super GameBoy Aspect Ratio

This allows you to apply the 8:7 aspect ratio to any of the Super GameBoy cores you may have installed. When selected you will be asked which cores you want to do this for.

The 8:7 aspect ratio gives you a more 'full screen' look and feel on the Pocket.

You also have the ability to reset any of the Super GameBoy cores back to the original 4:3 aspect ratio.

### Pocket Maintenance - Reinstall or Uninstall Cores

These give you the ability to reinstall all or select cores. The reinstall will erase and reinstall all core specific files and assets. It will not touch your ROMs or Save files.

If you wish to uninstall one or more cores, selecting 'Uninstall Select Cores' will allow you to choose which cores you'd like to remove. It will also prompt you to ask if you wish to remove core specific assets. Doing so will not touch your ROMs or Save files. 

### Pocket Extras

This section contains some extra functionality that individuals have created. Each item in this menu will provide a description and links to the authors GitHub before installing it. That way you get more information and can choose accordingly.

_Note: If you are an advanced user, you can disable the description functionality by setting the `show_menu_description` config setting to `false`_

There are 3 main categories:

#### Additional Assets

This contains extras that enhance or modify existing cores. For example, addition additional ROM support to Arcade cores or allowing an Arcade core to load multiple games rather than just one.

This type of extra requires you have the necessary core installed. If you don't, you will be prompted to install it.

#### Combination Platforms

This contains new platforms that combine multiple cores into a single one. This helps in reducing the number of items you see in your openFPGA menu on your Pocket and to leverage the 'Change Core' functionality.

#### Variant Cores

This contains a list of alternate core setups. These take existing cores and make copies of them with some changes, leaving the original core intact and providing new functionality with the additional core.

### Settings

 The following settings are all available via the `Settings` menu item.

## Jotego Beta Cores

Now that Jotego is releasing his beta cores publicly (and requiring a beta key to play them), you can just drop the `jtbeta.zip` file from patreon onto the root of your sd card and run Update All, and it will automatically copy the beta key to the correct folders for the cores that need it. It also will let you install the yhe cores directly from the updater, now. Make sure you don't rename the file, it's going to look for exactly `jtbeta.zip`

## Troubleshooting

 - Slow asset downloads? Try toggling `use_custom_archive` to true, in your settings.

 - If you run the update process and get a message like `Error in framework RS: bridge not responding` when running a core, try to run the updater in a local folder on your pc, and then copy the files over to the sd card afterwards. I'm not entirely sure what the issue is, but I've seen it reported a bunch of times now and running the updater locally seems to help.

 - I keep getting a `Missing ROM ID [1]` message when trying to launch arcade games in the _alternatives folder. Check your settings and make sure you have `Skip Alternative ROMS` turned off.
